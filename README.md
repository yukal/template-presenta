An adaptive html template

Due to the fact that the engine is very outdated and it became impossible to maintain, this template is marked as "xovno(ode" and currently undergoing deep code refactoring. 
Any dependencies like jQuery and Bootstrap are in the process of being demolished and the core engine is under reconstruction. But you can take a 
look at the oldest and the newest preview pages:
